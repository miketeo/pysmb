  to using SMB1 protocol.

  not properly converted to Epoch time.

  methods for a finer control of file retrieval operation with read offset and write
  limits.


pysmb-1.0.2, 31 March 2012
==========================

- Fix a bug in SMB._handleSessionChallenge() method in base.py where the domain attribute
  was not used to generate the corresponding NTLM authentication packets, resulting in
  the default WORKGROUP domain for used for all subsequent authentications.

pysmb-1.0.1, 25 Jan 2012
========================

- Fixes a bug in listPath() method which causes directory listing for
  sub-directories to return an empty list.
- Fixes an incorrect implementation of the TRANS2_FIND_FIRST2 and
  TRANS2_FIND_NEXT2 request/response handling which causes directory listing
  to crash when the remote directory contains a certain number of entries.

  for more files/folders information in subsequent SMB TRANS2 requests.

pysmb-0.4.4, 12 Jan 2004
========================

- Add in support for AMK's Python Cryptography Toolkit which will be used

  epoch time rather than SMB time.
- Remove debugging printout in smb.py which has been released accidentally
  with the last release.
- Fix a bug in smbcp which causes to local to remote copy to fail

pysmb-0.4.1, 22 Jun 2002
