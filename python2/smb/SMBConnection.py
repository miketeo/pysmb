        Create a new SMBConnection instance.

        *username* and *password* are the user credentials required to authenticate the underlying SMB connection with the remote server.
        File operations can only be proceeded after the connection has been authenticated successfully.

        Note that you need to call *connect* method to actually establish the SMB connection to the remote server and perform authentication.

        The default TCP port for most SMB/CIFS servers using NetBIOS over TCP/IP is 139.
        Some newer server installations might also support Direct hosting of SMB over TCP/IP; for these servers, the default TCP port is 445.

        :param string my_name: The local NetBIOS machine name that will identify where this connection is originating from.
                               You can freely choose a name as long as it contains a maximum of 15 alphanumeric characters and does not contain spaces and any of ``\/:*?";|+``
        :param string remote_name: The NetBIOS machine name of the remote server.
                                   On windows, you can find out the machine name by right-clicking on the "My Computer" and selecting "Properties".
                                   This parameter must be the same as what has been configured on the remote server, or else the connection will be rejected.
        :param string domain: The network domain. On windows, it is known as the workgroup. Usually, it is safe to leave this parameter as an empty string.
        :param boolean use_ntlm_v2: Indicates whether pysmb should be NTLMv1 or NTLMv2 authentication algorithm for authentication.
                                    The choice of NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 is configured on the remote server, and there is no mechanism to auto-detect which algorithm has been configured.
                                    Hence, we can only "guess" or try both algorithms.
                                    On Sambda, Windows Vista and Windows 7, NTLMv2 is enabled by default. On Windows XP, we can use NTLMv1 before NTLMv2.
        :param int sign_options: Determines whether SMB messages will be signed. Default is *SIGN_WHEN_REQUIRED*.
                                 If *SIGN_WHEN_REQUIRED* (value=2), SMB messages will only be signed when remote server requires signing.
                                 If *SIGN_WHEN_SUPPORTED* (value=1), SMB messages will be signed when remote server supports signing but not requires signing.
                                 If *SIGN_NEVER* (value=0), SMB messages will never be signed regardless of remote server's configurations; access errors will occur if the remote server requires signing.
        :param boolean is_direct_tcp: Controls whether the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (is_direct_tcp=False) or the newer Direct hosting of SMB over TCP/IP (is_direct_tcp=True) will be used for the communication.
                                      The default parameter is False which will use NetBIOS over TCP/IP for wider compatibility (TCP port: 139).
